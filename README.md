This is a simple script for dynamically changing the fan speed in a PowerEdge r730xd.  SFF or LFF it doesnt matter.

Install:
1) Run the database setup script by itself.
2) run the query script.  You could do this in tmux or screen or something.  I used pm2 myself
3) (optionally) run the web script if you want a simple website to monitor your fan rpm and cpu temps.

This wasnt meant to be something amazing. The purpose of this project was simply to quiet my office a little bit.
